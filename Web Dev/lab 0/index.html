    <h2>My favorite philosophical concept is idealism.</h2>
    <p>"Idealism in philosophy, also known as philosophical idealism or metaphysical idealism, is the set of metaphysical perspectives asserting that, most fundamentally, reality is equivalent to mind, spirit, or consciousness; that reality is entirely a mental construct; or that there is some higher "ideal form" of reality. Because there are numerous forms of idealism, it is difficult to define the term." <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism">Wikipedia</a> </p>

    <h3>Why I like idealism</h3>
